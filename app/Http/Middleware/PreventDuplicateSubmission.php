//  Maliyat Docs — PreventDuplicateSubmission
//  Location: app/Http/Middleware/PreventDuplicateSubmission.php
//
//  Stops the same form submission being recorded twice.
//
//  Nothing prevented it before. A double-click on "Record sale", a
//  phone that resends on a flaky connection, or an impatient second
//  tap while the first request was still in flight each produced two
//  invoices AND two payments — real money counted twice, in a
//  system whose whole job is counting money accurately. The user
//  sees two identical rows and has to work out which one is the
//  mistake, and deleting the wrong one takes its payment with it.
//
//  How it works: a fingerprint of (user + route + body) is held in
//  the cache for a few seconds. A second request carrying the same
//  fingerprint inside that window is sent back untouched, with a
//  message explaining why, rather than being written.
//
//  Why a time window rather than a token per form: a token means
//  every form in the app has to remember to send one, and the one
//  that forgets is silently unprotected — the same shape of problem
//  as the missing delete checks. A window protects every write route
//  the moment it exists, including ones not written yet.
//
//  The window is deliberately short. Entering the same figure twice
//  on purpose is a real thing people do — two identical 50 EGP cash
//  sales in a row — and after WINDOW_SECONDS that goes through
//  normally. What it cannot survive is the same body arriving twice
//  within a few seconds, which is not something a human does by
//  hand.
